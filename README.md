# Obsidian Zotero Integration Templates

The [Obsidian Zotero Integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration) allows for seamless extraction of notes from PDF files in Zotero into Obsidian. This can be customized by setting up templates with various functions. However, not everyone is familiar with coding or template customization, which can make this process challenging. To simplify it, Iâ€™m sharing my custom script to assist colleagues in getting started easily.

## Zotero Notes Import Template

**Purpose:**  
To import PDF highlights and notes from Zotero into Obsidian with minimal clutter.

### Requirements:

### Features:
- **Custom YAML Metadata**: Automatically updates YAML with relevant information based on the item type.
